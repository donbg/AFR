####BRIEF HISTORY
GEO_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "100 years have passed, and Georgia has finally regained its independence when the Russian Empire crumbled. Lead by the Georgian Menshevik Party, the country quickly adopted Social Democratic reforms and developed rapidly. However, after the 1934 elections the party has become increasingly split between a faction that wants to join the now libertarian Soviet Union, and a faction that can't trust the Soviets. Georgia has a choice. It can either join the Soviet Union, and forgo its national identity, or it can stay independent, but at the cost of its socialism. Or maybe there are other options?"

####EVENTS
ge.100000.t:0 "Georgia's Situation in 1936"
ge.100000.d:0 "After the October Revolution, the Russian Transcaucasian province broke off and formed the Transcaucasian Federation. However this state wasn't long for the world, as it soon broke into Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Seeing as the war's end would not come soon, the Georgians, lead by the Menshevik Party, invited the Germans to occupy Georgia (and protect them from the Ottomans).\nThe Georgians didn't take sides in the Russian Civil War, and while the Bolsheviks were initially hostile, in 1920 Georgia signed a peace agreement with the Soviet Union, which established the Bolshevik Party as a legal political party.\nAs the years went by, a new faction developed in the Menshevik Party. The old internationalists have received renewed interest as the Soviet Union seemed peaceful and prosperous. They weren't a major threat until recently, when they started advocating for Georgia to join the Soviet Union as an SSR. The current government of Georgia is from the other faction, those who are against joining the Soviet Union. The Chairman of Georgia, Noe Ramishvili, who has been elected after a constitutional amendment that abolished term limits and extended the term of the Chairman, has a strong anti-Bolshevik stance. However it seems like the pro-union faction gains more and more popularity every month..."
ge.100000.a:0 "Mretsveloba Gadaarchens Sakartvelos!"

ge.1000.t:0 "Ioseb Jugashvili Resurfaces"
ge.1000.d:0 "It seemed like after Jugashvili's long disgraceful exile from the Soviet Union due to his "comrades" in the Soviet leadership, he would never return to what he used to be. But it seems that we have misjudged him, since we have received reports of him inciting people against our government and forming a new party. He even tried to adopt his old nickname, 'Stalin', though without much success."
ge.1000.a:0 "Leave him alone"
ge.1000.b:0 "Imprison him for incitement"
ge.1000.c:0 "Bring someone to convince him that he's wrong"

ge.1001.t:0 "Jugashvili's Mother Convinces Him to Change His Ways"
ge.1001.d:0 "We have brought Jugashvili's mother, Keke Geladze, over to Jugashvili, in order for her to convince him to stop his rebellious activities and take care of her in her old age. It was obvious that even after all of these years, Jugashvili was still afraid of his mother and has promised to listen to her."
ge.1001.a:0 "He hated his father, but he loved his mother."

ge.1002.t:0 "Jugashvili's Meeting with His Mother Failed"
ge.1002.d:0 "We have brought Jugashvili's mother, Keke Geladze, over to Jugashvili, in order for her to convince him to stop his rebellious activities and take care of her in her old age. Unfortunately, while Jugashvili made efforts to appear respectful, it was obvious he wasn't going to listen to her and that he would return to his Vanguardist activities as soon as he could."
ge.1002.a:0 "Is Vanguardism stronger than a boy's bond to his mother?"

ge.1003.t:0 "Zhordania Convinces Jugashvili That the Mensheviks Have the Right Path"
ge.1003.d:0 "It seems like Zhordania has done the impossible. After a long meeting with Ioseb Jugashvili, in which the two discussed revolutionary matters and the old times, it seems like Zhordania has managed to convince Jugashvili that Bolshevism has failed and that the Mensheviks will lead the Socialist revolution. Jugashvili even promised to join the Menshevik Party and support it!"
ge.1003.a:0 "Isn't it great when two old Amkhanagebo reunite?"

ge.1004.t:0 "Jugashvili Storms out of the Meeting with Zhordania"
ge.1004.d:0 "Have we really expected anything different? Even though nobody could question the validity of Zhordania's arguments, Jugashvili has managed to do so anyway. There is no convincing this kind of nut. It seems like this meeting only made him even more convinced of the need to overthrow the government."
ge.1004.a:0 "Jugashvili is truly an insult to Socialism."

ge.1100.t:0 "The Coup in Georgia"
ge.1100.d:0 "Early in today's morning many independent cells of Vanguardist revolutionaries took over governmental and public buildings all over Tbilisi. Simultaneously, other groups have took over other cities, like Batumi, Kutaisi, Poti and Sokhumi. Amidst all of the confusion, an attempt was made to imprison key people in Georgian politics, but fortunately nearly all of those attempts failed and the politicians are now preparing to escape from the country."
ge.1100.a:0 "This is a dark time for our country."

ge.1500.t:0 "Beria Accused of Doing Indecent Acts Towards Army Women"
ge.1500.d:0 "Ever since we have allowed for the conscription of women, we have started to receive more and more complaints from women who have been assigned to work with Beria that he is doing indecent acts on them. How should we proceed?"
ge.1500.a:0 "Let it slide"
ge.1500.b:0 "Put him on trial"
ge.1500.c:0 "Send him to a psychiatrist"

ge.1501.t:0 "Beria Reacts Well to Treatment"
ge.1501.d:0 "We have sent Beria to a psychiatrist. After a few meetings, the psychiatrist has told us that Beria was reacting well to treatment and that in a few months he should be mentally healthy again."
ge.1501.a:0 "We should socialize mental healthcare to prevent such cases from happening in the first place"

ge.1502.t:0 "Beria Has Finished His Treatment"
ge.1502.d:0 "A man comes out of the psychiatrist's office. On first sight it seems to be the same man we sent off many months ago, but all of the people who knew him don't know him anymore. This Beria is a different, much more just Beria, and he wants to contribute to society as a show of gratitude for the treatment that he has received."
ge.1502.a:0 "We shall send him to officer school again to become a better field marshal"
ge.1502.b:0 "This man would make a great head of intelligence."

ge.1503.t:0 "Beria Didn't React Well to Treatment"
ge.1503.d:0 "It was obvious from the start that this isn't going to work. Beria is too set in his sadistic ways to ever change. Sadly, we can't do anything."
ge.1503.a:0 "How unfortunate."

ge.1.t:0 "Manganese Miners Go on Strike!"
ge.1.d:0 "With the recent London Stock Market Crash, the Manganese prices crashed, and the mine owners were forced to lower the wages of the Manganese miners. However, they didn't anticipate the strong reaction their actions have caused amongst the miners. The miners have gone on strike, and other trade unions are on the verge of striking too, out of solidarity and fear for their own jobs. While we anticipate the Crash won't affect us much more, our government is as unstable as ever, and it's likely that it will fall apart soon."
ge.1.a:0 "Unfortunately, the elections must happen earlier than expected."
ge.1.b:0 "Magram me megona rom mretsveloba gadaarchenda sakartvelos!"

ge.2.t:0 "Elections!"
ge.2.d:0 "While the elections were only planned to be held in the next year, they went smoothly regardless and people from all over the country voted. These are also the first elections since the 1934 constitutional amendment that abolished term limits on chairmans and extended their terms to three years. The results are in. The winner of the elections is:"
ge.2.a:0 "The Anti-Union faction!"
ge.2.b:0 "The Pro-Union faction!"

ge.3.t:0 "Snap Elections!"
ge.3.d:0 "After the coalition fell down the old Menshevik party has lost a lot of its popularity, so now is the chance for the formerly small parties to shine. The winner of the elections is:"
ge.3.a:0 "The Socialist-Federalist Party!"
ge.3.b:0 "The National Democratic Party!"

ge.10.t:0 "Monarchy Referendum!"
ge.10.d:0 "A controversial decision has been made by the coalition government to make a referendum about reforming the country into a constitutional monarchy and restorating the Bagrationi-Mukhrani dynasty to the Georgian throne. While at first everyone has thought this referendum had no chance of succeeding and was just a move to please the conservatives and the church, we know realise the referendum has a real chance of succeeding."
ge.10.a:0 "The Monarchy is restored!"
ge.10.b:0 "The Republic is kept!"

ge.100.t:0 "Georgia Proposes Building a Transcaucasian Railway"
ge.100.d:0 "Georgia has proposed expanding the current railway systems and linking them together for the betterment of our infrastructure. While some of our ministers oppose this as a Georgian scheme to get control of our infrastructure, others point out the obvious benefits."
ge.100.a:0 "We accept their proposal."
ge.100.b:0 "We will never deal with perfidious Iberia!"

ge.110.t:0 "The Georgians Request Arbitration Between Them and Separatists"
ge.110.d:0 "Georgia has had a long problem with separatism in their country. Ever since the days of feudalism Georgia was divided into different parts and even today they don't all share the same culture. We were requested to serve as a neutral arbitrator between them and their separatists to restore the peace."
ge.110.a:0 "The separatist regions deserve more autonomy."
ge.110.b:0 "Georgia is right, they already have enough autonomy as it is."

ge.120.t:0 "The Soviets Demand a Referendum in Sochi"
ge.120.d:0 "The Russians have long considered Sochi to be a part of their core territory, and now that we have chosen to join the Soviet Union they demand a referendum to figure out this issue once and for all."
ge.120.a:0 "We haven't thought about this when we joined the Soviet Union"

ge.121.t:0 "Should We Cheat in the Sochi Referendum?"
ge.121.d:0 "After the Georgian government has announced that a referendum will be held in Sochi to determine in which SSR it will be, some people have suggested that the Sochi population would be brainwashed by the Georgians to not accept our rightful ownership of their lands. They say that the Russian SSR certainly has the power to affect the referendum to be slightly in our favor. What should we do?"
ge.121.a:0 "The Sochi folk don't know what's good for them!"
ge.121.b:0 "We will win anyway, why cheat?"

ge.122.t:0 "Sochi Stays Georgian"
ge.122.d:0 "The referendum has ended, and the votes were counted. By large majority, the people of Sochi have chosen to stay Georgian!"
ge.122.a:0 "Three cheers for Sakartvelo!"

ge.123.t:0 "Sochi Has Chosen to Go with Russia"
ge.123.d:0 "The referendum has ended, and the votes were counted. The people of Sochi voted to be annexed by the Russian SSR. While some ministers have suggested that the Russians have cheated in the referendum, we can't do a thing."
ge.123.a:0 "The people of Sochi have made their choice."

ge.150.t:0 "Georgian-Armenian Talks"
ge.150.d:0 "We have met with the representatives of Armenia to discuss them joining a hypothetical Transcaucasian federation. While the meeting went positively, everyone noticed that the Armenians waited for a territorial concession from us."
ge.150.a:0 "Give them Tao-Klarjeti"
ge.150.b:0 "Give them Lori"
ge.150.c:0 "Don't give them anything"

ge.151.t:0 "Georgian-Azeri Talks"
ge.151.d:0 "We have met with the representatives of Azerbaijan to discuss them joining a hypothetical Transcaucasian federation. The meeting went very smoothly, and most Azeri representatives seemed to like the idea. However, some of the more nationalist ones have mentioned that we hold rightful Azeri territories."
ge.151.a:0 "Give them Zaqatala"
ge.151.b:0 "Don't give them anything"

ge.152.t:0 "The Transcaucasian Referendum!"
ge.152.d:0 "Millions of people, all over Transcaucasia, will vote today in the referendum about the reformation of the Transcaucasian federation. Now it doesn't matter what the politicians think of this, only what the people think."
ge.152.a:0 "We await the results, patiently but excitedly."

ge.155.t:0 "The People Support Transcaucasia!"
ge.155.d:0 "The results of the referendum were clear. The Transcaucasian people want to reform the Transcaucasian Federation. We are already in talks with Azerbaijan and Armenia about the technical details of this reunion."
ge.155.a:0 "From now, we have the same enemies and friends."

ge.156.t:0 "The People Voted Against Transcaucasia"
ge.156.d:0 "The results of the referendum were clear. The Transcaucasian people don't want to reform the Transcaucasian Federation. However, since we have already established friendly relations with the Transcaucasian governments we have agreed to form an economic and military union despite the political union being off the table."
ge.156.a:0 "This is still something, right?"

ge.160.t:0 "The Trapizoni Plebiscite"
ge.160.d:0 "People all over Trapizoni have voted today for their territory to join Georgia. While the Armenian government is still sore about this issue, the people of Trapizoni have spoken and the Armenians can do nothing about this."
ge.160.a:0 "They hate Georgians less than they hate Armenians."

ge.161.t:0 "The Trapizoni Plebiscite"
ge.161.d:0 "People all over Trapizoni have voted today for their territory to remain in Armenia. We are still not sure why they did this, but the Armenians have got to be behind this."
ge.161.a:0 "Not so democratic after all, eh?"

ge.170.t:0 "The Georgians Want to Join the Stahlpakt"
ge.170.d:0 "We were surprised when we received a message from the Georgian government about them wanting to join the Stahlpakt. While we already cooperated in the Great War, this sentiment was still unexpected. We suspect they want to leverage us to demand concessions from the Soviets."
ge.170.a:0 "The more the merrier"
ge.170.b:0 "Georgia is nothing but a burden"

ge.180.t:0 "The Georgians Demand North Caucasia"
ge.180.d:0 "Those little brats over at Georgia think they are might enough to demand that we hand them over North Caucasia. While we can only laugh at them threatening us, perhaps handing them over this insignificant territory is a good way to get rid of it and its instability."
ge.180.a:0 "Sure, they can have it"
ge.180.b:0 "What, are you kidding me?"

ge.190.t:0 "The Georgians Request a Guarantee for Their Independence"
ge.190.d:0 "We have had a friendly relationship with the Georgian government ever since we supported their independence after the Great War. Now they come to us and ask for a guarantee against the Soviet aggression and any other countries that seek to invade them. While such a guarantee might be benefitial to us diplomatically, a war in such a far away place could be dangerous to intervene in."
ge.190.a:0 "Very well, we can guarantee them."
ge.190.b:0 "They can deal with it on their own."

ge.191.t:0 "The British Deny Our Request of a Guarantee"
ge.191.d:0 "We shouldn't have expected anything else. The British have clarified that we couldn't expect any sort of a guarantee for their independence that would require them to go to war in our aid."
ge.191.a:0 "Perfidious Albion Strikes Again!"
ge.191.b:0 "We turn to France in this hour of need."

ge.192.t:0 "The Georgians Request a Guarantee for Their Independence"
ge.192.d:0 "We didn't deal much with the Georgians, but they still request a guarantee for their independence, mostly to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking them. They clarify that they have asked the British for a guarantee, but they have turned them down. Accepting this could strengthen us diplomatically, but a war in a far away place could be dangerous to intervene in."
ge.192.a:0 "We shall guarantee their independence."
ge.192.b:0 "They can search for their friends someplace else."

ge.195.t:0 "The Georgians Propose That We Join Transcaucasia"
ge.195.d:0 "After we have broken off our ties with the Soviets, we stand alone and without any friends. In such a dire situation, it made sense for the Georgians to propose that we join their federation. But this means giving up our freedom and giving in to a different country, the exact same thing we were trying to avoid..."
ge.195.a:0 "We will join their federation"
ge.195.b:0 "We can't give up our independence"

ge.199.t:0 "The Transcaucasian Elections"
ge.199.desc:0 "The time for new elections has come. While in the past the parties were divided by political ideology, we have seen the traditional parties of the Transcaucasian countries shift into parties that represent their entire nation."
ge.199.a:0 "The Georgian Candidate Wins"
ge.199.b:0 "The Armenian Candidate Wins"
ge.199.c:0 "The Azeri Candidate Wins"
ge.199.d:0 "The Female Candidate Wins?!"

ge.200.t:0 "The Georgians request that we arm them"
ge.200.d:0 "Georgia has always been a country at the heart of our caucasian interests. Now that they are expanding their army, they have figured that it would be best to ask us to supply them with their much coveted arms. While they don't really have much to pay with, they have promised they will be eternally grateful."
ge.200.a:0 "Why not?"
ge.200.b:0 "Why would we do that?"

ge.201.t:0 "[Prev.GetName] has refused to give us weapons!"
ge.201.d:0 "Unfortunately, [Prev.GetName] has refused to give us weapons even though we tried to convince them that it would be beneficial for them too. After this we have learned to lower our expectations of international aid to our country."
ge.201.a:0 "We will buy some weapons from arms dealers, but this won't give us much"

ge.210.t:0 "The Georgians request that we train some of their officers"
ge.210.d:0 "When the Georgians were in need of officer training, they knew the only nation they could go to is France. Only we had the expertise needed for them to succeed in their wars against their enemies, chiefly the Soviets."
ge.210.a:0 "Fine, we can train a few."
ge.210.b:0 "This is way too expensive for us."

ge.211.t:0 "The first officers to be trained in France return to Georgia!"
ge.211.d:0 "We have waited excitedly for the first batch of Georgian officers that were trained in Georgia to return to us, and now they did! The highest ranking officer that was sent, Dimitri Zedginidze-Amilakhvari, will now be commanding his own divisions."
ge.211.a:0 "Let's hope that they're up to the task!"

ge.220.t:0 "The Georgians request that we train some of their officers"

ge.220.a:0 "Fine, we can train a few."
ge.220.b:0 "This is way too expensive for us."

ge.221.t:0 "The first officers to be trained in Poland return to Georgia!"
ge.221.d:0 "We have waited excitedly for the first batch of Georgian officers that were trained in Georgia to return to us, and now they did! The highest ranking officer that was sent, Valerian Tevzadze, will now be commanding his own divisions."

ge.10000.d:0 "Ekvtime Takaishvili, our most renowned history professor in the Tbilisi State University, was honored in opening up a new exhibition in the Georgian Museum in Tbilisi. The exhibition was about the documents that were in the Transcaucasian archive from the Tsarist era. Among them are some fascinating findings about the extent of the Okhrana infiltration into the Georgian Bolshevik groups, that seem to put a lot of current Georgian Bolsheviks in a bad light."

ge.10001.d:0 "Thousands of football fans cheer as the Tbilisi Central Stadium is opened to the public.

ge.10002.t:0 "Chiaureli Releases Arsen"
ge.10002.d:0 "A new picture came out to Georgian cinemas today. The acclaimed film director Mikheil Chiaureli's new movie Arsen is about a Georgian soldier who returns from the Tsarist army and notices the oppression of the Georgian serfs by the Russian nobles. He organizes a rebellion against the Russians and together with Georgians from all classes who come to volunteer the rebellion expands and becomes a big revolt. Unfortunately the Russians manage to infiltrate the rebellion with agents that encourage the Georgians to surrender to the Russians, and the rebellion votes to accept a peace agreement with the Russians. Arsen leaves the group with his love Neno. \n\nIn the last scene, the results of the surrender are shown. Arsen returns to the once oppressed villages and only finds burnt ruins."
ge.10002.a:0 "This film shows that we can't trust the Russians."
ge.10002.b:0 "This only shows that nationalist propaganda is inferior to socialist propaganda."

ge.10003.t:0 "Chiaureli Releases The Great Dawn"
ge.10003.d:0 "Chiaureli hits us with another picture. This time, the movie is a satirical take on the October revolution. It shows how a Menshevik that was locked up until the February Revolution see the people's despair in the Great War and listens to a speech by Vladimir Lenin about how the Social Democratic party will bring salvation when it gets in power. Excited by the speech, he joins the Bolshevik faction, and later enlists in the Red Army. \n\nThe movie shows him traveling to different fronts, and being a part of a delegation to Ioseb Jugashvili, then known as Joseph Stalin, to stop the severe human rights violations that they are being forced to do. \n\nUnfortunately for them, Stalin locks all of the delegation up in the same prison he was locked in before and after a show trial attended by Stalin he is ordered to be executed. He manages to break out of the prison, only to meet one of the people he has seen in despair when he was released from that prison in the first place. The person tells him that the other people he saw were from his village and that now they are starving because of the Bolshevik policies and that he is searching for some food that fell off from the shipments to the prison. Saddened by this revelation he tries to escape from Russia. On his way he overhears a speech given by Stalin about how the great dawn of the revolution was broken and he begins to cry."
ge.10003.a:0 "This is a sobering reminder of the treacherous nature of the Soviets."
ge.10003.b:0 "Why is nationalist propaganda always so bad?"
ge.10003.c:0 "We will have a talk with this director."

ge.10004.t:0 "Georgia Joins the Soviet Union"
ge.10004.d:0 "Following the pro-unionist victory in the Georgian elections, this was seemingly inevitable. The Georgian Government has decided to transform the Democratic Republic of Georgia into the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, and has signed all of the relevant treaties that formally adjoin the Georgian SSR and the Soviet Union.\n\nWhen interviewed by journalists, [GEO.GetLeader] said: \"This is a historic day for Georgia, but not only it. This is also a historic day for worldwide Socialism. Nations must learn to come together for the greater good, instead of engaging in petty squabbles.\""
ge.10004.a:0 "Isn't Georgia a part of America?"
ge.10004.b:0 "We're reunited at last!"
