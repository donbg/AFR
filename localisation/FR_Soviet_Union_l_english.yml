SOV_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "After their loss in the Great War, the Russian Empire fell into civil war and the collectivist Bolshevik party soon found itself as the ruler of Russia. That power was eventually disputed by anarchist sailors in Kronstadt, who rose up to fight authoritarianism in the nation. The uprising was a success and a majority of the old Bolsheviks resigned as a more democratic form of socialism was implemented- Libertarian Socialism, where the workers are truly in control. The beacon of socialism worldwide charges headfirst into an unknown future, threatened by Polish ambitions and even by revengeful old Bolsheviks..."

#### events ####
soviet.1.d:0 "The old Tsarist regime was highly turbulent since the turn of the century, however the Great War put the final nail in the coffin of the Tsar, and later the Provisional Republic. Disastrous losses to the advancing German-Austrian Armies caused the precious little stability within Russia to plummet, shortly afterwards, the brutal conflict known as the Russian Civil War would develop. Many years of toil, struggle, and some luck had allowed Lenin and his Bolsheviks to establish themselves as the victors of the Russian Civil War. However, as the old saying goes, 'out of the frying pan and into the fire'.\n\nCountless years of war, death, and civil misery had led to the Krondstadt Rebellion which originated off the coast of Petrograd. With various other movements inspired by the Krondstadt rebellion beginning to spring up across the Union, Lenin acknowledged that if the matter was to be ignored, the USSR would soon find itself in Civil disarray.\n\nLenin accepted the terms of the so-called 'Krondstadt Ultimatum', and then resigned from the Party entirely. The RKP was transformed from an Authoritarian Bolshevik party into a relatively Liberal (by socialist standards) organization. Since then, Russia has seen herself on a clear path of liberalization and decentralization.\n\nToday, Russia stands as an isolated beacon of Socialism in an alien world. The following years will be decisive in deciding which role Russia will take on in the worldwide revolution, and which branch of Socialism she will subscribe to, but furthermore and perhaps of most importance would be the future of the Union itself."
###
soviet.15.d:0 "The face of Russian Politics has been drastically changed by the Krondstadt Ultimatum, and the RKP stands at the front as one of the most Liberal parties within the Union. The SRKYPMK stands as a broad organization of Leninists and Marxists, whilst the SNRP is highly authoritarian in nature, and follows Leon Trotsky's theories of permanent revolution.\n\nNonetheless, this election will shape the future of Russian Politics perhaps even more than the Krondstadt Ultimatum."
###
soviet.16.d:0 "An important matter of these elections are what each party plans to prioritze in Internal Development of Russia. The RKP plans to build new infrastructure to bind the nation together, and the SRKYPMK plans to expand the various industrial sectors of Russia. The SNRP however, advocates total militarization of industries."
###
soviet.17.d:0 "Female workers of the Soviet Union have worked for it's prosperity just as hard, if not harder, than their male counterparts. However, Bolshevik feminist Alexandra Kollontai claims that the Soviet Union is far from Marxist egalitarian ideals and suggests radical solutions to this issue. The topic has become particularly controversial in this election, and the various running parties seek to clearly assert their platforms concerning the matter."
###
soviet.18.d:0 ""
###
soviet.19.d:0 "The people of the Soviet Union are eager to spread their revolution following the years of recovery which was granted by the RKP's Liberalization. Even the RKP itself has become much more militant in nature, and the people of the union seek to carry the torch of revolution once more; however the RKP, SRKYPMK & the SNRP have different plans as to what our first steps onto the world stage should be."
###
soviet.20.d:0 "Civil Security has become an issue during this campaign due to a small surge in crime within the Union. Whilst not nessecarily a rampant issue, it's large enough for the citizens of the union to want change concerning the matter, however some citizens believe the matter is being overblown."

soviet.36.d:0 "In central Asia and the Caucasus many intellectuals have tried to mesh the teachings of Islam, as practiced by much of the local population, with the philosophy of Socialism. The Zakat is one of the 5 Pillars of Islam in which Muslims who are able to meet all their basic needs must donate part of there income to the less fortunate. Many see this teaching as one of the countless examples of how Islam and Socialism can be combined but many intellectuals are having trouble teatching these ideas to the rural population of these regions. It has been suggested that a unified council be formed to help organize these disperate efforts. Moscow has already given there support."
