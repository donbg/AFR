### Events ###
kmt.1.t:0 "The port city of Macau"
kmt.1.d:0 "Since the 1500s, the city of Macau has been under imperialist control. Now, with Portugal on the verge of economic disaster, we have a unique chance to seize the city and everything within it. Doing this could, however, anger more of the western powers, who still hold power in asia through trade and naval supremacy. Should we risk it to finally get rid of this imperialist scum?"
kmt.1.a:0 "Seize the port, and get rid of the imperial menace!"
kmt.1.b:0 "It is best not to interfer with the western powers..."
kmt.2.t:0 "The Kuomintang seized Macau!"
kmt.2.d:0 "Our trading port Macau, has been seized by the Kuomintang in our moment of weakness. Although, we can not do anything about this ourselves as our power is already stretched thin, Britain might help us tame the Dragon once more."
kmt.2.a:0 "We need Britain's help"
kmt.3.t:0 "Portugal asks for our assistance"
kmt.3.d:0 "The British foreign ministry received a letter from the Portuguese this morning. It is asking for the assistance in the taking of their port city: Macau. We can either let Portugal deal with it's own problems or threaten the Chinese with an embargo. This would surely cripple their industry."
kmt.3.a:0 "We shall demand that the Chinese return their unlawful land, or be embargoed."
kmt.3.b:0 "We want no part in this!"
kmt.4.t:0 "Britain threatens to embargo us!"
kmt.4.d:0 "The British, under the influence of the Portuguese no doubt, have demanded that we return our rightful land to the imperialists, or face an embargo."
kmt.4.a:0 "Macau is Chinese and shall stay that way!"
kmt.4.b:0 "This could end badly..."
kmt.5.t:0 "Britain has refused to help us!"
kmt.5.d:0 "The British have "after much consideration" decided it would not be "in their best interest" to help us in this situation."
kmt.5.a:0 "Damn them!"
kmt.6.t:0 "Macau is ours again!"
kmt.6.d:0 "Under British pressure, the Kuomintang has reluctantly ceded the city of Macau to us!"
kmt.6.a:0 "In Hoc Signo Vinces!"
kmt.7.t:0 "Hong Kong has been seized by the Kuomintang!"
kmt.7.d:0 "Sensing weakness within our great empire, the Kuomintang has seized Hong Kong!"
kmt.7.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
kmt.7.t:0 "The Kuomintang have seized Guangzhouwan!"
kmt.8.d:0 "Early this morning reports stating that our territory in southern China, Guangzhouwan, was stormed by Chinese soldiers fighting for the Kuomintang. Although, this port has only been in our possession for few decades, this is just insult to our already weakened nation."
kmt.8.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
