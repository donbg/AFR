CEN_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "After The Great War, The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, and thus, Czechoslovakia came to life. Later reformed into the Zapadoslav Federation due to various events in the Polish-Bolshevik war, their existance was always full of pain. Never-ending internal problems, and rise of nationalism among the regions of the republic make its government powerless, and the radical elements more powerful than ever. Zapadoslavia has two choices: Continue the short legacy of the first semi-Pan-slavic state, or to perish under the heel of the Germans who graspingly look at the majorily german lands of the Sudetenland and Silesia."
