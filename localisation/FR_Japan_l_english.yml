#### Bookmark Description ####

JAP_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Japan is rising. In less than a century it has pulled itself from an isolated, feudal society to Asia's most industrialised and modern state.

Many farmers struggle with the rapid pace of modernisation, and income inequality has exploded. The Zaibatsu, Japan's gargantuan conglomerates, have continued to stifle entrepreunership and innovation. It has been a golden age for Japan, but unless swift action is taken, stagnation may curse us. May the Emperor watch over us all."

JAP_Romanov_exiles_desc:0 "The erstwhile royal family of Romanov was able to escape eastward across Russia essentially intact. Offered settlement in Japan, the Romanovs have taxed political will and relations with the SSRs with their royal demands and upkeep. We should probably see to sending them somewhere else..."
